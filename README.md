# **Student Result Analysis**

## **Overview**
This project analyzes a dataset of **30,641 students** to explore factors influencing academic performance.  
Tech stack used: **Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn**.

## **Key Insights**

- **Gender Distribution**
  - Female students: ~50.3%
  - Male students: ~48.7%

- **Parents’ Education Impact**
  - Higher parental education → better student scores.
  - Children of parents with **Master’s degree** scored highest (Math ≈72, Reading ≈76, Writing ≈76).
  - Lowest scores observed when parents had only **some high school** education.

- **Parents’ Marital Status Impact**
  - Minimal effect on student performance.
  - Scores remain nearly same across married, divorced, single, widowed.

- **Outlier Detection**
  - Outliers present in Math, Reading, and Writing scores, but overall distribution is consistent.

- **Ethnic Group Distribution**
  - Group C: ~32% (largest)
  - Group D: ~26%
  - Group B: ~20%
  - Group A: ~14%
  - Group E: ~8%
